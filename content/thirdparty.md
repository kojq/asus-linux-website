We had quite some contributions from our community, outside of kernel hacking, asusctl or supergfxctl.

This page will be expanded when we become aware of new tools, scripts and other goodies someone has written to expand the functionality of our tools.

If you also want to share something with us, be sure to checkout our <a href="https://discord.gg/4ZKGd7Un5t" target="_blank" title="join us on Discord!">discord</a> community and our #third-party channel in there!
