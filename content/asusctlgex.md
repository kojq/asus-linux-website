## asusctl-gex is inactive

The current version of asusctl-gex is not feature complete with the current asusctl version so I set the extension as inactive for the time being.
We currently don't have the time to update and maintain it.

If you are familiar with TypeScript / JavaScript and have the time and muse to study and maintain the code, don't hesitate to contact us ðŸ™‚

## get asusctl-gex (inactive, awaiting updates)

## Requirements

* gnome >= 3.36.0
* [asusctl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl) >= 4.0

---

## Build Instructions

### Dependencies

* nodejs >= 14.0.0
* npm >= 6.14.0

### Building (production)

In a terminal enter the following commands as a user (**do NOT run as root or sudo**):

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl-gex.git /tmp/asusctl-gex && cd /tmp/asusctl-gex
npm install
npm run build && npm run install-user
```

_HINT: You will need to reload the GNOME Shell afterwards. (`Alt + F2` -> `r` on X11, `logout` on Wayland)_

### Building (development)

Instead of the
`npm run build && npm run install-user`
above, use this line instead:
`npm run build && npm run install-dev`

This will remove any production versions and installs the development version instead.

_HINT: You will need to reload the GNOME Shell afterwards. (`Alt + F2` -> `r` on X11, `logout` on Wayland)_ and probably manually enable the extension again.

### Source debugging

`cd` into the directory where you've downloaded the `asusctl-gex` source code and enter the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run debug
```
