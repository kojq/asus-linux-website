A very quick update. The work I've been doing has suddenly turned in to 12 patches.

The TUF RGB patch series recieved some extensive and very good reviewing, so I think it is in excellent shape now.

[TUF RGB patch series](https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/8/7/683) (includes a dGPU-only mode patch for a rare and specific kind of laptop)

[TUF GPU fan support](https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/8/8/8)

[X-Flow tablet mode](https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/8/7/690)

Each of those links has the patches + cover letters and commit messages.

If all goes well, this work should hit Kernel 6.0
